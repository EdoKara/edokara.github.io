# Andrew Brown

Welcome to my landing page. Here you'll find descriptions of some of the projects I'm working on and things I've done in the past. 

My goal with this website is to allow an expanded discussion of the work I've done, providing additional context that a résumé would not, and to discuss projects in a less formal way. 

## About Me

I recently graduated from the [O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs](https://oneill.indiana.edu/index.html) with an M.S. in Environmental Science. My time in the O'Neill School (I usually just refer to it as SPEA) has left me with a lot of interest in continuing to grow my knowledge base. I really enjoyed digging into water policy and science issues during my degree program, and hope to continue doing so in my first position in the industry. 


## Projects and Previous work

If you'd like to see some samples of my previous work and projects, you can find a list [here](/Projects/projects.md).
