# Andrew Brown

Welcome to my landing page. Here you'll find descriptions of some of the projects I'm working on and things I've done in the past. 
My goal with this website is to allow an expanded discussion of the work I've done, providing additional context that a résumé 
would not, and to discuss projects in a less formal way. 

## Projects and Previous work

If you'd like to see some samples of my previous work and projects, you can find a list [here](/Projects/projects.md).
