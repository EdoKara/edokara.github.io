# Andrew Brown

Welcome to my landing page. Here you'll find descriptions of some of the projects I'm working on and things I've done in the past. 

My goal with this website is to allow an expanded discussion of the work I've done, providing additional context that a résumé would not, and to discuss projects in a less formal way. I address these articles like they're for friends and family. 

## About Me

I'm currently a Water Resources Management Specialist working for the [Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov) on the environmental impact statement for the [Enbridge Line 5 Reroute Project](https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/EIA/Enbridge.html). My role in the project spans surface water hydrology, ground water hydrology, erosion/sediment modeling, and fisheries ecology. I've applied modern data science and analysis techniques and a healthy sprinkle of data engineering/automation to encapsulate a sprawling, complex, multidimensional project in terms that are understandable to the general public. I have been greatly aided by the knowledge from my degree program and my programming skills, which have led to spillover positives in other departments as I continue create solutions for my own lines of inquiry. 


I graduated from the [O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs](https://oneill.indiana.edu/index.html) with an M.S. in Environmental Science in 2023 with high honors.
