title: "Contributions to my Stream Ecology Capstone"

# Background

Stream Ecology was my capstone course for the graduate program at SPEA, and was a great way to practice and refine some of the skills
I enjoyed using in other courses with more independence. The basic structure of the class was to learn about one aspect of an EPA rapid bioassessment
each week, practice sample collection and analysis for that portion in field/lab days, and then write about our findings in reports.

There were 3 reports over the course of the semester, and the final one brought together all of our findings into one comprehensive discussion 
of the ecological health of our target site.

Our group worked in Upper Stephens Creek, a 3nd-order wadeable stream near Bloomington, Indiana. The stream is downcut but still has decent structure despite
sitting on bedrock.
